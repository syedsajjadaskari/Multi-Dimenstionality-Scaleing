# Multi-Dimenstionality-Scaleing

Used for dimensionality reduction when the input data is not
linearly arranged or it is not known whether a linear relationship
exists or not.

MDS is a non-linear technique for embedding data in a
lower-dimensional space.

MDS (multidimensional scaling) is an algorithm that transforms
a dataset into another dataset, usually with lower dimensions,
keeping the same euclidean distances between the points.

It can be used to detect outliers in some multivariate distribution,

The main objective of MDS is to represent dissimilarities as
distances between points in a low dimensional space such that
the distances correspond as closely as possible to the
dissimilarities.

nonlinear method to project in lower dimensions by saving
pairwise distances

The metric MDS calculates distances between each pair of
points in the original high-dimensional space and then maps it to
lower-dimensional space while preserving those distances
between points as well as possible
